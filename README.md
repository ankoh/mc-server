## Mendeley Cache Server

This project aims to build a cache server for the Mendeley API that identifies additional coherences and provides an extended REST API.

**This project is currently under heavy development.**


### Contribution

We use a [GitLab Server](https://gitlab.kohn.io/ankoh/mendeley-cache-server) bundled with [GitLab CI](https://gitlab-ci.kohn.io/projects/19) for continuous builds and deployments.

Feel free to contribute as soon as the software reaches a certain level of professionality.

**Attention: At the moment both servers use self-signed SSL certificates.**


### Deployment

Will be based on Docker and PyPi.
